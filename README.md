# Lisp Badge
A handheld computer with a self-contained keyboard and display that you can program in Lisp.

Version 6 updates the uLisp firmware to uLisp 4.3, adding support for arrays, and built-in documentation (see http://www.ulisp.com/show?41E0).

It also adds some extra key combinations to allow you to enter additional characters from the keyboard:

| Character | Combination |
| --------- | ----------- |
| ~  | Shift+ESC |
| % | Shift+DEL |
| : | Shift+ENTER |
| ? | Shift+SPACE |
